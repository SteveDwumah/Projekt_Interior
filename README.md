## About

This project is a part of a Fullstack Bootcamp. It was developed over the course of two days. Using Visual Studio Code, I built this project with HTML and CSS for styling.

The aim of this project was to practice the concepts learned in the first module of the Bootcamp, specifically HTML and CSS. The result is a flexible and responsive website that could serve as a rental platform for interior design. It features a Headline and a burger menu adapts to screen size. Additionally, it includes detailed product cards and a generally adaptive layout.
